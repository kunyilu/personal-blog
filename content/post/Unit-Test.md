## Test Double
* Stub: I will do whatever you say!
* Mock: I will make sure methods get called the right way!
* Spy: I stle the data you wanted!

Stub is for state verification. Mock and Spy is for behavior verification.

### Why use test doubles?
* Isolation: test doubles isolate the system under test from its dependencies.
    - Replace the dependencies with test doubles 

### Stub
* Stubs let you inject behavior

## Structure of unit test code
* A part where you set up.
* A part where you execute the code.
* A part where you do assertions.
